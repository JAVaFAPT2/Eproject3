# Vehicle Showroom Management System - Requirements Specification

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document specifies the requirements for the Vehicle Showroom Management System, a comprehensive software solution designed for car dealerships to manage inventory, sales, customers, and generate reports.

### 1.2 Scope
The system will handle the complete vehicle sales lifecycle from purchase to billing, supporting multiple user roles with appropriate access controls.

### 1.3 Architecture Overview
The system will be built using **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** with **Clean Architecture** and **CQRS** pattern, ensuring separation of concerns, testability, and maintainability.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Domain Layer**: Core business logic and entities
- **Application Layer**: Use cases and application services
- **Infrastructure Layer**: External concerns (database, file system, etc.)
- **Presentation Layer**: User interface and API endpoints

### 2.2 Clean Architecture
```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Presentation  │  ← Controllers, Views, DTOs
├─────────────────┤
│  Application    │  ← Application Services, Commands, Queries
├─────────────────┤
│    Domain       │  ← Entities, Value Objects, Domain Services
├─────────────────┤
│ Infrastructure  │  ← Repositories, External Services
└─────────────────┘
```

### 2.3 CQRS Pattern
- **Commands**: Write operations (Create, Update, Delete)
- **Queries**: Read operations with optimized data retrieval
- **Command Handlers**: Process write operations
- **Query Handlers**: Handle read operations

### 2.4 Dependency Injection Container
- **ASP.NET Core DI Container** with custom extensions
- **Scrutor** for assembly scanning and registration
- **MediatR** for CQRS implementation
- **AutoMapper** for object mapping

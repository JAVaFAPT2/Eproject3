## 🔧 RECENT ENHANCEMENTS IMPLEMENTED

### ✅ **Invoice Relationship Fix**

#### **Problem Solved:**
- Invoices were only linked to SalesOrderId
- Needed service billing capability

#### **Solution Implemented:**
```csharp
// Enhanced Invoice Entity
public string? ServiceOrderId { get; set; }    // NEW: For service billing
public string? SalesOrderId { get; set; }      // Existing: For sales billing  
public string InvoiceType { get; set; } = "Sales"; // NEW: Sales/Service classification

// Domain Methods Added
public void SetForSalesOrder(string salesOrderId)
public void SetForServiceOrder(string serviceOrderId)
public bool IsServiceInvoice => InvoiceType == "Service"
public bool IsSalesInvoice => InvoiceType == "Sales"
```

#### **Business Impact:**
- **Service Revenue Tracking** - Separate service billing from vehicle sales
- **Labor & Parts Billing** - Detailed service cost breakdown
- **Service Profitability** - Track service department performance
- **Customer Service Bills** - Professional service invoicing

---

### ✅ **Order Status Management Enhancement**

#### **Problem Solved:**

- Needed comprehensive status tracking after creation

#### **Solution Implemented:**

#### **Enhanced OrderDto**
```csharp
// Status Tracking
public string Status { get; set; } = "DRAFT";
public string StatusDescription { get; set; } = string.Empty;
public DateTime? StatusUpdatedAt { get; set; }
public string? StatusUpdatedBy { get; set; }

// Delivery Management  
public DateTime? DeliveryDate { get; set; }
public DateTime? EstimatedDeliveryDate { get; set; }

// Priority & Communication
public string? Notes { get; set; }
public string? InternalNotes { get; set; }
public int Priority { get; set; } = 1; // 1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High
public bool IsUrgent { get; set; } = false;
```

#### **Enhanced UpdateOrderStatusRequest**
```csharp
public OrderStatus Status { get; set; }
public string? StatusDescription { get; set; }
public string? Notes { get; set; }
public string? InternalNotes { get; set; }
public DateTime? EstimatedDeliveryDate { get; set; }
public DateTime? ActualDeliveryDate { get; set; }
public int Priority { get; set; } = 1;
public bool IsUrgent { get; set; } = false;
public string UpdatedBy { get; set; } = string.Empty;
```

#### **New Order Management Endpoints**
```http
GET  /api/orders/{id}/status-history    ✅ Complete audit trail
PUT  /api/orders/{id}/priority          ✅ Priority management
POST /api/orders/{id}/notes             ✅ Communication tracking
```

POST /api/service-invoices/generate/service-order/{id} ✅ Auto-generate from service
POST /api/service-invoices/{id}/payment              ✅ Service payment processing
```

### **CreateServiceInvoiceRequest**
```csharp
public string ServiceOrderId { get; set; } = string.Empty;
public decimal LaborCost { get; set; }
public decimal PartsCost { get; set; }
public List<ServiceInvoiceLineItem> LineItems { get; set; }
```
